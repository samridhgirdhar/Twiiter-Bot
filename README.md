# About the Bot
Twitter bot class has a getSecrets method which allows us to pull all the API keys from the yaml file.
These are then used in authenticating the user.
Once the user is successfully authenticated, we first fetch some tweets using search_tweets function, in which we are passing in the query of getting 'bbc world news' with a count of 2, result type recent which is basically fetching 2 latest world news
getMajorHeadlines function then return a string the fetched tweets
We then utilize this result to update our own status, using update_status function of twitter api. Since a tweet can only be maximum of 270 characters, we are slicing the string from the beginning to 270 characters. and then we return out of the function. The result ==> we can see our tweet in out profile on twitter!
